1. run [ED_Chapter5.py](ED_Chapter5.py) to creat a elctric field intensity map of a electric dipole radiation

2. run [ED_Chapter5_plus.py](ED_Chapter5_plus.py), which produces a series of full field electric field intensity  distribution of a electric dipole radiation maps.

3. run [video_maker.py](video_maker.py), which produce a video consists of full field electric field intensity distribution maps of a dipole radiation produced by ED_Chapter5_plus.py.

4. run [video_editor.py](video_editor.py), which can edit the video, like adding calling card and BGM, etc..
5. [video of dipole radiation](videos/finalVideo.mp4)
