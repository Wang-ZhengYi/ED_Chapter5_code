# A series of electrimagnetic field intensity simulations of electric dipole, electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole radiation, and the energy flux density simulation of atenna and atenna arrays.

## This is a code assignment for Electric Dynamics Chapter5 2019,BNU. 

### Created by Z.Y.Wang @ BNU [codes details](https://github.com/Wang-ZhengYi/ED_Chapter5_code)

1. run [Edipole_map.py](Edipole_map.py) to creat a elctric field intensity map of a electric dipole radiation

2. run [Edipole_video.py](Edipole_video.py), which produces a series of full field electric field intensity  distribution of a electric dipole radiation maps.

3. run [video_maker.py](video_maker.py), which produce a video consists of full field electric field intensity distribution maps of a dipole radiation produced by ED_Chapter5_plus.py.

4. run [video_editor.py](video_editor.py), which can edit the video, like adding calling card and BGM, etc..

5. run [mp4togif.py](mp4togif.py),which can convert *.mp4 to *gif.
